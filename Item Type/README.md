## Item Type
Item Types are a data structures that define a specific set of data. Theses are commonly referred to as *Items*. 
Items are effectively a bucket that holds information that are relevant to the specified Item Type.

The above example visualizes the basic structure of an Item Type as it is represented in Teamcenter and an example alongside it. The example shown is that of a Physical part. Physical parts have weight and are made of some kind of material. A physical part's geometry is also defined using a CAD application, in this case we gave the example of a NX and Solidworks dataset. We also allowed a PDF dataset to the Item Type if a PDF is generated from the CAD application. 

This introduces the concept of an Item Type but only scratches the surface. We will go into greater detail on the various forces at play on an Item Type in the Item Type directory.
