# Item Type
Item Types are a data structures that define a specific set of data. Theses are commonly referred to as *Items*. 
Items are effectively a bucket that holds information that are relevant to the specified Item Type. 

An Item Type is different than an Item in that an Item Type is how an Item is defined. For example, I can have an item type that specifically holds data that related to electrical components and an item type that specifically holds mechanical components. These two separate Item Types, electrical and mechancical, have different attributes defined to each other. A specific example could be that for an electrical component you need to have an attribute of 'voltage rating'. In contrast, the mechanical part would hold data that does not discern the concept of voltage, making that information irrelevant.
