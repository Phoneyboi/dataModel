# Out of Scope
Defining what is *out of scope* is as important as defining what is *in scope* when defining a data model for engineering systems.

## Drafting Standards
Title blocks, drawing templates, units of measurement, drawing views, notes, and other drafting standards are not a high focus area in defining a data model for your engineering organization. Ask yourself the question, what drafting standard affects the way I store and release data? If you find that somehow there is a relation, then by all means hash that out. For data models, the main concern is the process of reviewing and releasing data. You might have a separate release procedure for mechanical parts versus electrical parts which will have different drafting standards associated with each, but the drafting standard does not determine how data gets released. Drafting standards are typically a separate issue that should be address regardless of data model definition.
