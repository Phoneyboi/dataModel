# LOV
LOV stands for "List of Values". The english language really does a disservice when someone wants to refer to a bunch of **Lists** of Values and then talk about a specific **List** of Values. The reason I bring this up is that it is an important distinction between saying "the **Lists of Values** in Teamcenter are many" versus "there are a lot of values in this **List of Values**". 

Anywho, a LOV are data that is created in Teamcenter which is typically used as a selection criteria. One of the most basic LOV that is created is a simple Yes/No LOV. Lists of Values are attached to data to define workflow steps, attributes, and other multiple choice criteria.
