# Organization 
The Organization created in Teamcenter can cause some controversy either in its creation or during its practical use. People will refer to something called the *Security Model* which the Organization is a critical piece. We will go into security models in Teamcenter as well so we can get a clear understanding of that idea. But for now lets lay out some operations the Organization should and should not do for your business. 

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Organization Should</th>
<th>Organization Should Not</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

1. Be simple
2. Define Roles who have 'Review' and 'Release' rights
3. Define Roles who do not have 'Review' and 'Release' rights

</td>
<td>

1. Overly complex
2. Restrict access to sensitive data
3. Mirror the business job titles

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If you abide by these general rules of thumb, this will create a good baseline for your Organization in Teamcenter. We will go into how we can extend the Organization by defining attributes to each User and how this affects the user experience/security model in Teamcenter.
