# Organization Example
Our example is going to first show the layout of the Organization and then it will show what **I think** is the best organiation structure I've seen.

As a point of fact, the layout of the organization is representative of a heirarchical tree as seen below.

With this structure in mind, I will show you what **I think** is the best organizational structure I have seen below. This is specifically a Group for Engineering.![Organization Example](https://github.com/Phoneyboi/dataModelTeamcenter/assets/90519425/775c2a57-d4c8-42cc-bf6a-26e7a515228c)

Obviously, this should be modified to your business needs but it solves our initial Should and Should Not criteria. This organizational structure is simple, it defines a role called Senior Engineer that can review and release data in Teamcenter, and it defines a role Mechanical Engineer that is not allowed to review and release data in Teamcenter; likewise for Electrical Engineering. There is an added Drafter role which is meant to be a role that only authors data, not particularly for approval of data.
