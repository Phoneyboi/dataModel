# Starting the Data Model Journey
There will be businesses who are starting from scratch, and businesses who will be migrating from an established PDM/PLM system. These are two very different approaches to developing a data model. Starting from scratch should be viewed as a straight forward implementation of processes and attributes. Migration is a complex endeavor as it requires translating processes and attributes from one system to another as well as moving data from one database to another. 

## Avoidable Issues in Data Model Journeys
1) **Trap of over planning**

    Insight: Attempting to make everything perfect on the first iteration of your data model will drive you crazy and will result in lots of 'work' that never results in anything actionable. *Planning to define* engineering processes is much different than *defining* engineering processes. Having clear objectives and assigning responsibility is the job of the person planning the data model endeavor.
   
    *Takeaway: Define clear objectives and assign responsibility to the appropriate individuals. Planning is usually not a one-way door. Create actionable information and iterate from that information.*

2) **Shotgun Data Models**

    Insight: The fire-from-the-hip attitude for data models will result in ill-planned structure and result in a graveyard of unused options, attributes, workflows, item types, groups, roles, etc. This approach will clutter up your system and make working in the system very confusing for the user and difficult to maintain for your administrators.

   *Takeaway: Define a purpose for why you are doing what you are doing. Answer questions like, "What Roles do I need in my organization and what are their purpose"? This will guide your decision making to achieve logical conclusions.*

3) **Diffusion of Responsibility**

     Insight: Make sure you get **sign-offs** from the responsible parties for decisions made on data models. More specifically, sign-offs should be required when documenting a specific process, LOV's, attributes, etc. This ensures accountability and leaves a trail of "Who did this?" and "Why did they decide to make this change?".

   *Takeaway: Assign responsibility to the people who define specific components of the data model. Perform a regular follow up with the responsible individuals to ensure timely execution.*
