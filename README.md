# Data Models for Teamcenter 
In this project, we will be developing a template for how data models can be created for organizations who are 
implementing the Teamcenter PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) system for their origanization.

## Project Structure
This project will be structured with relevant topics listed as directories in the project heirarchy. For example, you 
will see a directory with the title **LOV** for a deeper dive into *Lists of Values*, a directory titled **Item 
Types** for *Item Types*, and so on and so forth.
