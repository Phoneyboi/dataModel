# Where to Begin
Lets go through the logic of where to begin and why (unless you genuinely know a better way). Below you will find two headings; Processes and Classification. In an ideal world, these two subjects will be tackled in parallel. The reason why these two subjects are so important is because if defined properly, your result will give you everything you need to know about Item Types, LOV's, Organization, Project, Change Management, Access Manager, etc. Your result will allow you to begin solutioning your Teamcenter environment to your business needs. 

## Processes
Defining your processes will uncover the attributes you need to properly configure the PLM system. There are a few processes that are typically required in organizations which will be listed below: 

1) Release (Production Release, Final Release, Master Release, etc.

    It doesn't matter what you call this process if at the end of this process there is a status placed on the data that the business recognizes as complete-complete.

2) Obsolete (Discontinued, Retired, etc.)

    This process is meant to place a status on data that means the data will no longer be revised/maintained/manufactured.

3) Change (oh boy, this is a doosie)

    Change is going to be split up into multiple different processes. Change is a defining branch of engineering data management that brings out the true value of PLM systems. Change is also a point of pain for most organizations. More in depth discussion can be found in [Change Management](./Change%20Management/README.md). 

      a) PR (Problem Report)

      b) ECR Fast Track (Engineering Change Request)

      c) ECR Standard Track (Engineering Change Request)

      d) ECN (Engineering Change Notice)
