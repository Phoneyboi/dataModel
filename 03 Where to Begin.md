# Where to Begin
Don't wait, start now. 

## Processes
Defining your processes will uncover the attributes you need to properly configure the PLM system. There are a few processes that are typically required in organizations which will be listed below: 

1) Release (Production Release, Final Release, Master Release, etc.

    It doesn't matter what you call this process if at the end of this process there is a status placed on the data that the business recognizes as complete-complete.

2) Obsolete (Discontinued, Retired, etc.)

    This process is meant to place a status on data that means the data will no longer be revised/maintained/manufactured.

3) Change (oh boy, this is a doosie)

    Change is going to be split up into multiple different processes. Change is a defining branch of engineering data management that brings out the true value of PLM systems. Change is also a point of pain for most organizations. More in depth discussion can be found in [Change Management](./Change Management/README.md) 

      a) PR (Problem Report)

      b) ECR Fast Track (Engineering Change Request)

      c) ECR Standard Track (Engineering Change Request)

      d) ECN (Engineering Change Notice)
