# Change Management
   Your organization will have to decide the appropriate level of concern for the management of engineering change in your organization. As an example, if you have engineered a coffee mug and decided to make a modification, it is likely not *required* that you officially need to document the problem that led to your change. A coffee mug does not typically fall under an agency jurisdiction that needs to be regulated, such as the FAA. Speaking of the FAA, aircraft are typically under high regulatory scrutiny which having a robust change management process can help in documentation of changes made to parts that are manufactured for aircraft. Obviously, you do not *need* a PLM to manage the documentation of change to engineering data. The idea of the PLM is that it can be configured to make sure that all the bases are covered for documenting change. The value of a properly configured change process is that you do not miss any critical pieces of documentation, ensuring that someone is responsible for required documentation instead of leaving it to chance in a malconfigured system/systems.
