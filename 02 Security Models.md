# Security Models
What is a security model and why do I need one in my PLM? 
## Princples
1) Data are to be categorized in three separate buckets: Public Domain, Confidential, and Restricted.
2) Groups and Roles are to be developed as a function of the *responsibility* that is designated for the role.
3) The more locations data are stored, the more difficult it becomes implementing data security. The fewer locations data are stored, the simpler it makes implementing data security.
4) Judgement of who gets to see what data is to be based on the concept of 'need-to-know'.
